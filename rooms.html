  <h2>More Rooms</h2>

  <p>As houses get bigger, there is more room for more rooms. Now we can see rooms like the dining room, guest room, laundry room, and home office.</p>

  <h3>Dining Rooms</h3>
  
  <p>You can also find dining rooms in many homes, but a lot of the times dining rooms are consolidated into the kitchen or living room, especially in places like cities, where there may not be enough space to have every room you want. The dining room is a room with a table that you can eat at.</p>

  <p>Guest's rooms are like bedrooms, but for guests. They have all the same fixins as a bedroom except would be inherently less personalzied as it has no designated person</p>
